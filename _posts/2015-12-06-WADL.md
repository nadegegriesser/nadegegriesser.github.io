title: Where has my WADL gone?
---

With previous versions of CXF, accessing http://localhost:8080/rest/persons?_wadl was enough to get a WADL.

This is no longer the case.

To obtain a WADL, you can add the following dependency to your pom.xml.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
  <artifactId>cxf-rt-rs-service-description</artifactId>
  <version>3.1.4</version>
</dependency>
```

Call the URL again, now it is there.
